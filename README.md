This repository contains an implementation of lexical analyzer, parser, intermediate code generator, and runtime environment (intermediate code executor) for SIL language (Simple Imperative Language).


1. Our compiler and runtime are built in Windows OS.
2. The tools that we have used are ANTLR4.7,JDK 1.8.
3. Directions to install and run the language 

a.) unzip the folder and open cmd and go to the directory where compiler.jar and runtime.jar are present.
For example, if you want to run a file SurfaceAreOfCuboid.sil which is inside codes folder.

To compile .sil-

java -jar Compiler.jar codes/SurfaceAreOfCuboid.sil

.................................................................

TO run .silc file:-

java -jar Runtime.jar codes/SurfaceAreOfCuboid.silc
